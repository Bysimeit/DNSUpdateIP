## FAQ

#### Why did I create this code?

My ISP only provides me with a dynamic IP address and knowing that I own a few servers, I needed to have a bot that automatically changes the IP address in the DNS of my domain.

#### Why didn't I put a CNAME type DDNS address instead?

I didnâ€™t want to have the Cloudflare alert telling me that CNAME records cannot be created at the apex of the domain.
